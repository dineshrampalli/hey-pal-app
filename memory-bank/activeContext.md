# Active Context: Hey Pal App

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on conducting a thorough analysis of the existing codebase to build a comprehensive understanding of the project. This involves:

*   Mapping out the component hierarchy.
*   Understanding the data flow and state management.
*   Identifying key patterns and conventions used throughout the application.

## Recent Changes

*   **Memory Bank Initiated:** The `memory-bank` directory and its core documentation files have been created to establish a foundation for project knowledge.

## Next Steps

*   **Component Analysis:** The next step is to analyze the implementation of each thematic component (`Header`, `Hero`, `Ringmasters`, `SilentPartners`, `TheAudience`, `TokenSection`, `Footer`) to understand their specific content and functionality.
*   **Update `progress.md`:** After analyzing the components, `progress.md` will be updated with a more accurate assessment of the project's completeness.
