## Problem Solved

"The Great Indian Circus" is a satirical web platform that uses the metaphor of a circus to comment on Indian politics. Its primary purpose is to raise awareness about corruption and political issues in an engaging and humorous way. The platform frames political figures as "Ringmasters," corporate interests as "Silent Partners," and the public as "The Audience." Each group is broken down into satirical archetypes that comment on their roles in the political landscape.

## How It Should Work

The application presents a satirical narrative where users can "Enter the Circus" to witness the "show" of Indian democracy. The `$40PCT Token`, a Solana-based meme token, is a central element. Its key feature is a "Scandal Burn Mechanism," where tokens are burned in response to real-world corruption news, creating a deflationary model tied to the project's satirical theme. The "Buy Tickets" call to action directs users to purchase the token on platforms like `pump.fun`.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Engaging & Thematic:** The user experience should be immersive, leveraging the circus theme to make the content memorable and engaging.
*   **Clear & Intuitive:** Despite the creative theme, the application must be easy to navigate. Users should be able to understand the purpose of each section and find the information they need.
*   **Role-Based Distinction:** The interface should clearly distinguish between the different roles (`Ringmasters`, `SilentPartners`, `TheAudience`), providing tailored information for each.
