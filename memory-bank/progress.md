# Progress: Hey Pal App

## What Works

*   **Core Application Shell:** The main application shell is functional, including routing and the initial `CurtainOpening` animation.
*   **Component Structure:** All the main thematic components are present and composed correctly on the `Index` page.
*   **UI Library:** The `shadcn/ui` component library is integrated and provides a consistent set of UI elements.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Component Content:** The content and specific logic within each thematic component need to be analyzed to determine if they are placeholders or complete.
*   **State Management and Data Fetching:** The use of `@tanstack/react-query` needs to be investigated to understand what data is being fetched and how it's used.
*   **User Interactivity:** The interactivity of the application, such as form submissions or button clicks, needs to be examined.

## Current Status

The project is in an initial analysis phase. The core structure is in place, but the completeness of the features and functionality is yet to be determined.

## Known Issues

*   No known issues at this time. This section will be updated as the codebase is explored in more detail.
