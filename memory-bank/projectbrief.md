# Project Brief: Hey Pal App

## Core Requirements & Goals

"The Great Indian Circus" is a satirical web application that uses a circus theme to comment on Indian politics. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, its primary goal is to raise awareness about political issues and corruption in an engaging, humorous way. The project is structured around different "performers" (stakeholders) and features a native token, `$40PCT`, which is a play on the "40% corruption rate" theme.

## Key Features (Inferred)

*   **Modern UI:** The use of React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS suggests a focus on a modern, responsive, and maintainable user interface.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The project is structured around reusable components, which will help in maintaining a consistent look and feel across the application.
*   **Clear Navigation:** The presence of `Header`, `Footer`, and a `pages` directory indicates a standard multi-page web application structure.
*   **Thematic Content:** Components like `Ringmasters`, `SilentPartners`, and `TheAudience` suggest a unique, possibly circus-themed, presentation of content.

## Technical Stack

*   **Framework:** React
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Package Manager:** bun
